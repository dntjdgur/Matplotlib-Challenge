# Matplotlib-Challenge

#### Experiment Data Pythonic Statistical Analysis & Visualization
#### The subject jupyter notebook file calculates basic statistical analysis of the experimental data on mice versus Tumor.
#### The following is the screenshots of part of the script to calculate each statistics:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### The dataset is as follows:

![Dataframe](/images/dataset.jpg)

###### The followings are the brief screenshots of the results calculated out of the script.

#### [Volume Statistics]: Basic Statistical properties

##### Here is how the statistics were calculated:
![Statistics](/images/statistics.jpg)
##### Each statistical results were transformed into dataframe:
![Statistics Dataframe](/images/dataframe.jpg)

#### [Pharmaceutics Statistics]: Drug counts were measured from the data, prior to the visualization

![DrugCount](/images/drugcount.jpg)
##### List of the drug was retrieved to label the visualization:
![Druglabel](/images/druglist.jpg)
##### Final product of visualization (into bar graph to compare # of drug treatments for mice versus Tumor Volume):
![Drugbar](/images/labeledbar.jpg)

#### [Mice Gender Demographics]: Visualization of the distribution of female versus male mice:

![Genderdemo](/images/piechart.jpg)

#### [Tumor Volume Statistics]: Analyzing and visualizing the tumor volume statistics out of the provided dataset:

![TumorvolumeStat](/images/tumorstat.jpg)
##### Tumor Volume Statistics into box plot to show the correlation between each regimen and tumor volume:
![Boxplot](/images/boxplot.jpg)

#### [Tumor Volume versus Capomulin]: Statistical Analysis and visualization between the tumor volume and Capomulin treatment

##### Dataframe that is restricted to the Capomulin dataset:
![Capomulinstat](/images/scatterplot_data.jpg)
##### Capomulin statistics visualized into Linechart:
![Linechart](/images/linechart.jpg)
##### Tumor Volume versus mouse weight visualized into scatterplot:
![Scatterplot](/images/scatterplot.jpg)
##### Average Tumor Volume versus the mouse weight visualized in linear regression model, with correlation coefficient:
![Linearregression](/images/linearregression.jpg)
